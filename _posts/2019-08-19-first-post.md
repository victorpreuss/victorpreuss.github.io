This blog is about electronics, firmware and low-level software, FOSS, Linux ricing, mathematics and whatever else I'm interested at the time. I've recently acquired a Thinkpad T400 in order to play around with Libreboot and also riced an Arch system from scratch on it, so I might as well start posting about that. I also acquired an analog oscilloscope and want to talk about it and make some experiments.

This blog is written with the help of Jekyll and Github pages. I've started a simillar blog venture recently using just plain HTML and CSS (for minimalism) and was paying for a host service and all, but it was a pain and I've decided (for now) to simplify my approach to the design of the blog and focus mainly on the content. Seeya!
