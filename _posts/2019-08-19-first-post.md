This blog is about electronics, firmware and low-level software, FOSS, Linux ricing, mathematics and whatever else I'm interested at the time. I've recently acquired a Thinkpad T400 in order to play around with Libreboot and also riced an Arch system from scratch on it, so I might as well start posting about that. I also acquired an analog oscilloscope and want to make some experiments with it.

Seeya soon!
