In this post I intend to link several videos, pdfs and posts that I find interesting. This will be updated regularly as I remember or find more interesting stuff.

**Recommended Youtube channels**:

- [The Signal Path](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxRARSpahF1Mt-2vbPug-g) - Simply amazing. In depth analysis, teardown and fix of very complex RF/Microwave lab instruments. Some episodes are also followed by very interesting and sophisticated experiments using the high-end equipments, exploring their strengths and weaknesses. Dr. Shahriar Shahramian shares a lot of his (amazing?) knowledge in microwave engineering (and other topics) throughout those videos.
- [OpenTechLab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeF7JKNXOy0jpMOxpgbZcpg) - His videos involve low-level firmware (C, assembler/linker, USB and other protocols), electronics, open-source tools, reverse engineering, 3d printing and many other cheap and very interesting devices. The videos are incredibly well edited and contain a huge amount of practical knowledge.
- [w2aew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiqd3GLTluk2s_IBt7p_LjA) - Alan Wolke provides a great collection of incredibly didactic and hands-on videos in introductory concepts for RF design such as IQ modulation, Smith Charts, non-linearities, mixers, couplers and many others. A must watch for novices in the RF world.
- [Behzad Razavi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClH7sqfyOoJ3jpeAqWZX7WA/featured) - Two electronic courses presented by Prof. Behzad Razavi. An excelent intro to semiconductor devices and electronics.
- [Ali Hajimiri](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeF7JKNXOy0jpMOxpgbZcpg) - A collection of great classes ministered by Prof. Ali Hajimiri from semiconductor physics to noise, LNAs, oscillators and phase noise, PLLs and more.
- [Jordan Edmunds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEmBUvaW0UhAbPz4IiscKgw/videos) - Provides some nice and short classes using a colorful board. There are videos about electromagnetism, optics and photonics, RF amplifiers, antennas and more.
- [Keysight EEsof EDA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzexaoG8Uec4DXPXyFyWGcQ) - Several ADS tutorials exploring signal integrity, RF PA design, EMC and EMI analysis, 5G waveforms and conceptsand many more.
- [Plextek RFI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClZFUtAnlLZK6FrMQ1yPV2Q/feed) - Some interesting tutorials on the design of mm-wave VCO, mixer, balun, PAs and some presentations of their IPs.
- [Jeri Ellsworth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTpDNIOtgfRkyT-AFGNWVw) - Jeri is a self-taught inventor with many interesting videos on electronics, optics and some cool old technologies.
- [Sam Zeloof](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7E8-0Ou69hwScPW1_fQApA) - Oh boy ... a teen creating semiconductor chips in his garage. He can even wirebond them at home. Epic.
- [mjlorton](https://www.youtube.com/user/mjlorton/videos) - Many interesting videos on a big variety of devices (many high-end lab equipments).
- [KF5OBS](https://www.youtube.com/user/KF5OBS/videos) - Some interesting RF videos and equipments review.
- [Brian Douglas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0imsn84ShAe9PBOFnoIrg) - Amazing videos to review the basics of control theory. Great didactic and excelent video format.
- [devttys0](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuEqgu-PN4B2Jm_B5tccPCA) - Some interesting videos on electronics and RF.
- [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCivA7_KLKWo43tFcCkFvydw) - Damn, all sorts of chemistry, mechanical and electrical engineering experiments.
- [kridnix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsPTB1A8Yom5M4yTU3EqNzw) - Nice videos on electromagnetism, anthennas and the physics behind waves and impedances.
