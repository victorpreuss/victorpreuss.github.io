Hello!

My name is Victor Preuss and I'm a brazilian electrical engineer. I currently live in Florian√≥polis and am pursuing a master's degree in the field of RF and microwave electronics at UFSC.

Currently, my main interests are:
- RF circuits
- Analog electronics
- Embedded systems (low-level firmware stuff)
- Linux and open-source software (I even own a Thinkpad T400 running Libreboot, ArchLinux (btw) and a riced i3 environment hehe)

If you wanna contact me, please send me an email at vhpreuss@yahoo.com
