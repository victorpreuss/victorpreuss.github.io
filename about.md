My name is Victor Preuss and I'm currently pursuing a master's at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in the field of RF and microwave electronics. My main interests are related to RF technology and computers, specially linux related stuff and open-source software. I'm the happy owner of a librebooted T400 and use a riced i3 environment running ArchLinux.
